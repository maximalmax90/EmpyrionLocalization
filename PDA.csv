Dozens of banks of disruptors with no blind spots and acceleration beyond what any vessel that size should be able to handle.\nTo date, only one Eradicator has ever been destroyed and only because it had been forced into the gravity well of a Gas Giant after being rammed by a Tovera-Class Dreadnought.

A Ghy'st squadron encountered it during deep reconnaissance into Legacy-controlled space as it was observed destroying a fully corrupted planet.

It is still not known whether the ship came down from the moon in [c][8ab3ff]The Downfall[-][/c] or if it was buried in the ice all this time.\n\nThe spacecraft was taken to the nearest and best-equipped facility in [c][8ab3ff]New Zealand[-][/c] that was able to properly perform the examination and replication of the alien technology where it underwent extensive testing and experimentation at the hands of the world's best specialists.\nProgress was slow, as many of the materials the spacecraft (named ""[c][8ab3ff]Phoenix-1[-][/c]"") was made from could not be found or replicated and the computer systems that operated the ship were heavily degraded. Even still, the technological advancements in a multitude of scientific fields was significant and by 2461 the first UCH-built spacecraft capable of extrasolar warp was built: The [c][8ab3ff]UCH-001 Hyperion[-][/c].\n\nAfter dozens of successful warp tests over the course of four years, the Hyperion was determined to be a success and full-scale production of a Fleet was ordered. [c][8ab3ff]Operation Phoenix[-][/c] was confirmed.\n[b]There were two goals to this UCH Fleet:[/b]\nThe first was to find more of the materials retrieved from the Phoenix-1 and establish a supply line back to Earth. Using the technological advances of the alien technology to reverse the damage dealt to the planet from The Downfall using new materials in terraforming applications.\nThe second, if the first failed, was to find and colonize a habitable planet and begin the transfer of the human population to the new planet.\n\nIt wasn't surprising that the alien spacecraft recovered from Antarctica was equipped with weapons, they were theorized to be used for destroying meteorites and preventing collisions. Until the final flight of the Hyperion in [c][8ab3ff]2472[-][/c], where a long-ranged warp jump past Jupiter where the fleet was being assembled at [c][8ab3ff]Apollon Station[-][/c] ended with the disappearance of the Hyperion.\nThere were no problems with the Hyperion's warp drive and no observable issues with its insertion into [c][8ab3ff]Hyperspace[-][/c].

pda_CKKWES4,"[b][c][ffffff]Shields:[-][/c][/b]\nShields are defensive countermeasures employed by a variety of vessels and structures designed to deflect or absorb the impacts of conventional kinetic weaponry and explosives; reducing their damage to a structure by consuming power and a catalyst (Pentaxid).\nWhile shields will protect from any weapon, they are highly resilient to [c][ffffff]kinetic weapons[-][/c] such as [c][ff5c5c]Miniguns, Cannons, Flak Shells, Rockets, Missiles, Railgun Slugs[-][/c] and [c][ff5c5c]Artillery Shells[-][/c].\nConversely, shields are highly susceptible to damage from [c][ffffff]Energy-based weapons[-][/c] such as [c][6bd600]Lasers, Plasma, Positron Beams, Electromagnetic Pulse Weapons, Antimatter Torpedoes[-][/c] and[c][6bd600] Ion Cannons[-][/c] that will quickly deplete shields under sustained fire.\n\nThe majority of Zirax weaponry consists of energy weapons. However, in order to operate in any atmosphere, their weapons possess lower accuracy, speed and lose a great deal of energy in thermal output. This makes their lasers easier to dodge for faster crafts and deal less shield damage than the weapons of Polaris, Kriel or the UCH but more versatile.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Shield Boosters:[-][/c][/b]\nA recent advancement in shielding technology has lead to the development of shield modulation technology. In the past, shields were a fixed thing. You would use a shield and it would provide total protection.\nWith the advent of the Shield Booster technology, it's possible to improve the strength or charging speed of your shields. They do come at a cost however as the devices draw power while the shield is charging and are quite heavy.\n[b][c][00ff00]Shield Capacitor:[-][/c][/b] Increases the strength of your shields, but reduces the speed at which they recharge slightly.\n[b][c][ffbb00]Shield Charger:[-][/c][/b] Increases the recharge speed of your shields, but reduces their strength slightly.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Obtaining Advanced Shields:[-][/c][/b]\nShield Generators are upgraded from the lower grade to the higher grades using a Multitool set to the Upgrade Mode. Shield Generators can similarly be downgraded using the Downgrade function.\nYou must have the correct Shield Generator unlocked in your Tech Tree and the materials to upgrade in your inventory or in a connected container.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_aCCiai8,"[c][00ffee][u][b]CPU Restrictions:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nEvery structure has a pre-set limit of CPU that the Core uses to run your ship's systems. If you exceed the maximum CPU limit, you will begin to take penalties to your efficiency that will negatively affect your ship's performance in several aspects.\nThrusters will produce less thrust, Generators will output less power, Weapons will take longer to reload, Turrets will turn slower and Constructors will function at reduced speed.\nThis is particularly dangerous in combat as reduced power output will cause your generators to overheat and begin to take damage and eventually explode while accelerating.\nBuilding blocks do NOT consume CPU.\n\n[u][c][00ffee][b]CPU Extenders:[/b][-][/c][/u]\nAs you run low on CPU, you can suppliment your Core's default CPU amount with Extenders that will consume power to output additional CPU and increase your CPU limit roughly equal to the core itself.\nThe amount of CPU given from each Extender is shown on the extender block itself, so the more extenders you have, the more CPU you will get in much the same as generator or oxygen or fuel tank usage. [c][ff0000]There are [i]no[/i] CPU Tiers[-][/c].\nUnlike with the default game, if you lose a CPU Extender, your ship is not instantly crippled, followed by all the generators exploding. You lose only the CPU that extender represented; reducing your efficiency if you were close to the limit, but nothing more.\n\n[c][00ffee][u][b]Building for Efficiency:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nBigger is better. Larger thrusters are more CPU, Power, Mass and Space-efficient over multiple smaller thrusters; The same rules apply to generators, oxygen and fuel tanks.\nFocus your ship's function into a single role. It's better to do one or two things really well, than trying to win a fight carrying everything you own slowing you down and making every fight a nightmare as even the smallest amount of hull damage may lose valuable cargo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike similar large spiders of earth, the arrangement of eyes, chelicerae and lack of hair makes actual classification difficult due to it's ability to consume and digest food internally, which is completely different from any known earth spider.\n\nPossessing brown or tan camouflage coloration on the legs, abdomen and thorax; and hinged chelcerae with secondary jaws, the Erebus Spider survives as an ambush predator. Hiding amongst trees, bushes and tall grass until potential pret approaches before launching in a headlong sprint at its target.\nMidly-venomous, the Erebus Spider relies on its chelicerae to pincer the limbs of its prey and break bones with its impressive biteforce, thus preventing escape and allowing the spider to take its time dismembering its prey.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: The Erebus Spider is an invasive species of arachnid commonly found on many planets in the local system. The presence of these spiders on so many planets indicates that they were intentionally or accidentally introduced from another planet.\nWhile destructive to native flora and fauna, they survive mostly on a diet of Leafcutter Insects, but are not averse to attacking anything that strays close to their nests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite it's massive size, its exoskeleton is mostly hollow in order to regulate temperature in direct sunlight.\nUnlike the Erebus Spider, the Charon Spider has quite strong venom and does not possess the ability to seize and hold prey. Instead choosing to strike fast and retreat while its poison takes effect and begins to slow the target enough for it to go in for the kill with little risk for itself.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: The Charon Spider is fairly solitary and do not roam far from their nest; usually under large rocks and in canyons in arid regions near streams or springs where prey are most common.\nAlthough found on many planets, they are not destructive to the environment and are known to keep many of the more dangerous predator's numbers in check.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much like the namesake, the Pluton Spider is found underground in caves and abandoned buildings where it's cool, damp and dark.\nPluton Spider are known to take down predator and prey several times their size due to their ability to spit venom to stun and incapacitate the target without ever getting into reach.\nSpecially developed eyes and exoskeleton allow it to see infrared and adjust the patterning across its back to improve concealment. While it does possess minor camouflaging abilities that let it adjust the patterns on it's body, it cannot change the coloration.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Pluton Spiders rarely stray into daylight and so an accurate count of their locations and population density is unknown. They are found in many planets and have a preference for the damp, dark confines of abandoned buildings and the biomechanically-grown arterial tunnels left in the wake of a Legacy infestation over the caves they evolved to survive in. It's believed that this preference is due to the radioactive nature of any Promethium-powered reactor and the self-sustaining energy systems inherent in Legacy technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a leaf-green exoskeleton with a marbled brown to red carapace running from the optical turret at the top of its head to its tail.\nDespite the name, the Leafcutter Insect is more closely related to Crustaceans rather than other hexapods. Omnivorous, it bears compact internal organs beneath its hard carapace and a protruding optical turret that gives it a 270 degree field of view of its surroundings.\n\nDespite lacking the ability to bite any interloper in their territory due to their unusually arranged mouth, their specially-evolved forelegs possess an extremely powerful kick capable of denting steel. Coupled with sharped, edged barbs on the backs of the forelegs typically used for cutting plant stems and dragging food into their mouth, they allow the Leafcutter Insect to pierce and hang onto their would-be predator.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Leafcutter Insects are commonly found all across the Andromeda Galaxy, usually in temperate grassy plains and forests where much of their food is found.

Despite it's fearsome appearance, the Thymosaurus is largely passive; Eating mostly carrion and some large insects. It prefers to roam solitarily across temperate planet's equatorial band in search of potential mates.\n\nThe Thymosaurus' intimidating appearance belies it's fragile physiology as it suffers from poor eyesight due to the size and position of its eyes on its broad head coupled with inadequate reach and strength in its forelimbs. These weaknesses are made up for with the incredible strength of its hind limbs and tail, on the end of which it possesses a heavily armored thagomizer which it can swing with a force upwards of 1000 Newtons.\n\nWhile not naturally aggressive, the Thymosaurus has an exceedingly thick hide and bones, making it very durable to both impacts and penetration; necessary when fighting off rivals for a mate that are similarly equipped with a spiked, hammer-like tail for which it's named.\nAs such, it's best to avoid angering one if at all possible as they are known to pursue an aggressor back to their home and exact retribution.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Thymosaurus are typically found on temperate planets, between grassy meadows and the savannah where their chosen food source (Erebus Spiders and Leafcutter Insects) are most abundant.\nAlthough they are known to eat Telluropods, they will generally avoid large bodies of water due to their propensity for overbalancing. Drinking from a lake or pond for a Thymosaurus is typically done from a prone position, which leaves it open for attack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Used to deposit eggs into the wound made by the stinger, and poison in order to slowly kill the target; ensuring a rich environment in which the new hatchlings can grow.\n\nOriginating from a barren, red, volcanic environment the Nyxiss Scorpion evolved to blend in with the reds and browns of it's home world. It has extreme resistance to high temperatures and can survive in temperatures exceeding 700 degrees celcius. This resistance to heat has aided them in becoming widespread across the galaxy by climbing into the vents and thruster exhausts of landed cargo ships and escaping to more temperate planets; provided they can survive in vacuum long enough.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Nyxiss Scorpions can be found on a wide variety of planets; usually in warm, dark or radioactive environments underground. They are very rarely seen on the surface and prefer to hide in vents in abandoned structures or the organic arterial tunnels left in the wake of a Legacy infestation.\nOn their home planets, volcanic activity and high temperatures force them to remain on the surface and avoid underground burrows making their appearance on magmatic worlds far more common; and their appearance much harder to discern among the red rocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a chitinous exoskeleton that protects its internal organs and powerful legs, the Wraithworm Queen outclasses any other known insect in both size and mass.\nBy expanding the chitin plates on it's abdomen it is able to inflate it's stomach and align it's esophagus linearly and by contracting the muscles rapidly can expel toxic and corrosive gastric juices as a projectile up to 30 meters as a defensive mechanism.\n\nMale Wraithworms are far smaller than their female counterparts, being mostly blind and short limbed; they spend almost all of their lives burrowed deep underground. Males attract female Wraithworms by creating a spacious burrow for the queen, with walls hardened with saliva excreted to support larger rooms.\nFemales will choose males that provide the largest burrow, determining that they possess the strength, skills and hardening to produce better offspring.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Although not as numerous as the male counterpart; the Wraithworm Queen is the most commonly encountered due to its size. They do not burrow as the male does, so spend most of their unmated time above ground until approached by a prospective mate.\nThis is problematic on inhabited planets, as males will often burrow into artificial structures and claim them as a nest to attract females.

Having developed a means of eating while underground, it is incapable of eating it's food while above ground. Seemingly oblivious to anything on the surface unless defending itself.\nLike female wraithworms the Sandsiphon can spit a ball of digestive fluids at an attacker or when startled that is both toxic and corrosive to most metals.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Sandsiphons are quite common on arid and desertous planets. However, due to their nature of burrowing through the sand, they are rarely seen on the surface. Furthermore, the vibrations set off by nearby hover engines cause them to panic and burrow beneath the sand, making ground observations by biologists difficult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems to share a common evolutionary path to those of the Dromaeosaurid Genus of the Cretaceous period, but with a tendency towards a more reptillian form over the feathered contemporaries of our own galaxy.\nThis development is thought to be due to their environment being primarily tropical where the development of feathers would hinder the creature while stalking prey in the wet jungle and cause numerous health problems.\n\nAndroraptors travel and hunt in family packs, with the younger raptors being educated during the daytime by following behind the parents and imitating their actions to take down prey with supervision. During the night however, the parents hunt freely making night time especially hazardous for prey and human alike as these fully-grown raptors are larger, faster and more vicious at night while unrestrained with taking care of youngsters.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Androraptors are widespread across the Andromeda galaxy and common on most breathable Temperate planets. How or why they were spread across the galaxy is still unknown, but due to the slight genetic variations it's believed they were seeded there at least several hundred thousand years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is distantly related to the Androraptor, but appears to be further up the evolutionary chain and more closely related to the bird-like development as seen in earth's dinosaurs.\nOviraptors move in mated pairs, ranging great distances without claimed territory while raising their offspring. Only building nests to house their eggs and early stages of development of their children until they're old enough to begin moving on their own.\n\nOviraptors are omnivorous, eating berries, fruit, mushrooms and nuts when available; hunting vertebrates such as Erebus spiders and Leafcutters when easy prey is encountered. But otherwise are completely passive to anything that does not immediately pose a threat to them or their young. Preferring to flee, rather than attack when approached unless something harms their offspring.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Oviraptors prefer cold climates and are often found in or near snow in family groups of two adults and as many as five young. They are not harmful to the environment and do not engage in territorial disputes with other life forms.\nAlthough parents will attack anything that harms their offspring; the children themselves are curious and playful and will often follow and get into mischief in human camps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where the mouth was equipped with several sets of heavy molar-like teeth on the creature's palate, assumed to be used for eating plants. Live examples identified that the teeth were used to grind bones and rock salt from dry seabeds.\n\nIgnidon live solitary lives in open dunes, assuming the appearance of rock formations during the day to keep heat down and to lure prey to approach them in search of insects found beneath desert rocks. Roaming the desert at night when it's cooler and relocating to a new resting place by dawn.\n\nUnusually, the Ignidon's upper esophagus is equipped with valve that allows it to vomit an organic oily compound produced in a humped cavity between the creature's shoulders that will ignite when exposed to oxygen. This compound is usually used in mating displays, but can also be propelled with significant range and dispersal to become a jet of flame; amending the name ""Agni"" (Fire) to the taxonomic name of the creature.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Ignidon are commonly found in arid and desert environments; They appear most commonly in sandy dunes and at the edge of water sources and most prominently at night.\nThey are not particularly fast on their feet and have limited eyesight, making them only a minor nuisance to locals traversing the desert in hover vessels at night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of an Androzoan sting are very similar to Frostbite, causing localized crystalization in the smaller blood vessels.\n\nAndrozoa's diet consists primarily of smaller vegetation and carrion. It is too slow and lacks eyesight for any sort of hunting, but is known to eat small animals or birds that attack or land on the Androzoa and are stung enough to render them immobile.\nAndrozoas will react to any perceived threat to them, including defending others of their kind.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Androzoas are uncommon; usually found on the ocean floor away from most people.

However, in the case of the lumbering Megalonops there appears to be little reason why this creature has survived as long as it has with how poorly-evolved it is.\nThe megalonops' eyes are developed for the bright conditions typically found in desert or snow environments with large, almost clumsy feet designed to spread it's weight over an uncertain surface like sand or snow. Despite this, the Megalonops' gait is awkward, ponderous and slow. Not a useful development in a predator built for hunting.\nDespite this, the Megalonops is capable of hunting the larger of the sand-burrowing creatures such as Wraithworms, Sandworms and Sandsiphons that lack mobility while tunneling; With a long neck and sealable nostrils, the Megalonops is capable of slamming it's massive muzzle into the ground with great force and speed to seize shallow prey.\n\nUnfortunately, this head and body designed for hunting subterranean prey is ill-suited for battle or even running. Making it harmless to anything that should attack it on the surface.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Megalonops are typically found most commonly in desertous environments; with some subspecies found in snowy environments.

Rising slowly and carefully in the vicinity of prey, typically covered in vines and rotting vegetation to obscure its smell and appearance.\n\nLike other members of the Gigas family, the Swamp Gigas has a tendency to collect shiny objects that it finds while traversing it's home environment; often using them in an elaborate mating ritual by presenting their most impressive finds to a prospective mate in an unusually human act.\nSuch acts are generally performed after a suitable nest or den has been found or constructed; usually inside large hollow tree trunks above the water line.\n\nAs expected of a creature of this size, the Gigas has significant strength and speed coupled with bone-reinforced knuckles it can deal extreme blunt force trauma with even a glancing blow.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Swamp Gigas are found exclusively in humid environments, rich in vegetation and water; preferring the murky waterways than the shore, jungle or beaches. Leaving the water only to construct a den for mating purposes.\nSwamp Gigas are very good at concealing themselves, even from thermal scanning. This makes an accurate count of them very difficult, but it's estimated that there are less swamp gigas than either of it's brethren.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Branching off from the main Andromedan genus several hundred thousand years ago, likely due to adverse environmental factors. The result of this evolutionary change includes developed legs designed for prolonged travel at speed and a vertically-aligned mouth developed for eating the bark of the larger and hardier trees; rather than leaves or grass. This trait is also shared by the Leafcutter insect, suggesting a common factor.\n\nMoularidons form family packs or herds of females and offspring much like Elephants. Males, or bulls roam either alone or with other males until breeding season. Although there is often threat displays and sparring among the males when contesting a mate, there are rarely any serious fights that cause injury.\n\nBecause of their intelligence, size, strength and stamina, the Tal'ohn utilize Moularidons for transport and heavy lifting. Taking a great deal of care of their Moularidon population and protecting wild herds from Zirax poachers, even at risk to themselves.\nMoularidon are also farmed for milk by the Tal'ohn as one of their main exports, commanding a high price on the commodities market. Attempts by outside groups to farm Moularidon for milk on a commercial scale have failed repeatedly, keeping this product firmly in Tal'ohn hands for the forseeable future.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Moularidon are found exclusively on Temperate planets, rich in trees and wildlife. They will typically spend their days in open meadows near a water source and venture into the forest to feed on the bark of the older trees.\nThey avoid the rainforest and jungles at night due to the increased Androraptor presence as this is the time when the Adults hunt, and are known to target Moularidons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Be prepared and get your turrets up quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_CW0OCiG,"[b][c][00ffee][u]Base Attacks:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nYou've placed your first Base, which means you're ready to establish advanced production methods required for improved thrusters, weapons and ammunition for higher quality ships. However, the Zirax are aware that you have built a base and likely on a planet in their domain.\nThey will be sending troop transports, Drones and Bombers to take out your base, so the first thing you need to get in place to protect your investments are [b][c][ff5c5c]TURRETS[-][/c][/b]. Without Turrets, you have no hope of defending your base from even the most minor of attacks.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Point Defense:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nThe first thing you'll need on your base is a Generator, Fuel Tank, Ammunition Container or Controller, a Small Constructor (for Base) or better. With your constructor powered and supplied, you can now produce your first turrets with basic materials (Iron, Copper, Silicon) that will keep your base defended.\n\n[b][c][ffae00]Projectile Turrets (Base)[-][/c][/b]\n[b][c][ffffff]Minigun Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Minigun Turret is the best weapon for base defense. While it has slightly shorter range than the Cannon Turret, it has a higher rotation speed, better tracking and a higher damage modifier against drones and troop transports. It suffers a damage penalty against blocks though, making it less effective when used offensively against ships and POIs.\n[b][c][ffffff]Cannon Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Cannon Turret is best used against ships and blocks. It's more accurate than the minigun turret, but turns slower while tracking a fast object (E.g. Bombers). It suffers from a minor damage penalty against drones and other entities, while receiving a damage bonus against armor blocks.\n\nBy taking manual control of either turret, you gain extra combat effectiveness.\n[b][c][ffffff]Minigun Turret:[-][/c][/b] By holding LMB + RMB you can remove the safety limiter on the turret and fire it manually far faster than the turret can fire on it's own. You will lose accuracy at long range though.\n[b][c][ffffff]Cannon Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Cannon turret will also fire slightly faster while operated manually. RMB lets you change the ammunition settings to fire incendiary rounds that explode when they hit an enemy.\n\n[b][u][c][ff0000]Enemy Units:[-][/c][/u][/b]\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Minigun Siege Drones:[-][/c][/b] These relatively slow-moving drones are well armored and equipped with specialized ammunition designed to impart thermal damage to shields; causing more damage than regular UCH ammunition to shields.\nUltimately, these drones are designed for focused attacks and search and destroy missions.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Rocket Siege Drones:[-][/c][/b] High-speed drones equipped with a pair of rocket racks. They circle your base before launching a bombardment of low-impact rockets over a wide area. In order to function at this speed, they are only lightly armored and can be destroyed by a Minigun Turret or two easily.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Light Bomber:[-][/c][/b] The most dangerous unit deployed in early base attacks is the Light Bomber. More durable than the Rocket Siege Drones and with considerably better accuracy; the Light Bomber drops a single high-explosive bomb at key targets on your base.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Troop Transport: [-][/c][/b]The light troop transport is durable, but slow aircraft. It can carry up to 8 troops and is unarmed, but will usually not exceed a squad of 6. Your typical full base attack will consist of at least one Troop transport supported by siege drones acting as both protection and decoys while the transport lands.\n\n[b][u][c][ff0000]Invasion Force:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nInvasion level base attacks only occur on higher difficulty planet and ONLY if your base is placed within zirax-claimed territory. You will have a high chance of getting a different set of enemies that are going to [i]really[/i] want to take your base.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Siege Drone (Minigun)[-][/c][/b]: Twice the firepower, Twice the size, Triple the health.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Siege Drone (Rocket)[-][/c][/b]: Same firepower, twice the size, twice the health.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Bomber[-][/c][/b]: A more durable, angrier version of the Light Bomber.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Troop Dropship[-][/c][/b]: Better armored, these dropships can carry up to 16 troops.\nA high-end invasion force will not be a couple of drones and a transport; you'll be facing a dozen drones and multiple dropships hell-bent on taking your base or turning it into a smoldering crater.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Tal'on Base Attacks:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nIf you're unlucky enough to anger the Tal'on, they too will attack your base. Not with drones or transports, but with overwhelming numbers of hunters and animals. It may seem comical, but many people have lost their bases against the Tal'on because they failed to eliminate the Shaman.\n\nIn the event of a Tal'on Base Attack, your goal should be the immediate removal of the Tal'on Shaman. You can see their location from the glowing pillar of light they produce. As long as one Shaman remains, more enemies will continue to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An abomination is the resulting Third Stage of genetic reconditioning by the virus as it has broken down the host's body down to the most vital elements and over time will slowly reconstruct the host by incorporating materials both organic and synthetic to create a new lifeform with the Fourth Stage.\nDue to a lack of stimulus and direction from the Gestalt that makes up the Legacy, Abomination very rarely evolve into a fourth-stage entity; eventually falling into stasis at a stalled state of development.\n\nAbomination are physically strong and moderately fast, possessing adaptive thermo-regulation that allows them to survive in the most hostile of environments, including the vaccuum of space. They possess no ranged weapons and due to the presently dormant state of the Legacy Virus, are usually not contagious. They still carry a host of bacterial and viral afflictions for which they are asymptomatic, but still carriers.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Abominations can be found in legacy-infested buildings left abandoned following an infection; usually born from a Legacy Node left submerged beneath the ground from the War of Silence that has activated upon receiving stimulus from intelligent activity or mining operations; awakening it temporarily before it returns to a dormant state, The damage already done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While their higher cognitive and fabrication abilities appear to have been lost in the resolution of that long-ago war, they are still a force to be reckoned with. Their internal bioreactors are still functional, but at present only produce waste materials in the form of Pentaxid and other exotic elemental products.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Overseers are comparatively rare among the Legacy's creature; but can be found on barren and metallic planets in quite large numbers. The reason for this is still unknown, since the Legacy did very little material extraction and there is very little or no life on those planets to infect.\n\nBecause of the distinction between the Overseers in the past, when the Legacy was fully awake and the remnants left in the wake of the war; the original Overseer is now designed an ""Overlord"".

Some weapons are better at some things than others, even though it may not seem like it. Others can be either too heavy or have too much recoil to be fired over a long duration, requiring restraint. There's no use in overusing a heavy weapon and being too exhausted to raise it when you need it.\nUse the information contained within this data package to help you decide on which kind of weapon you need for each type of enemy.[-][/c]\n\nThe creatures and people you'll encounter in the galaxy are a wide assortment from the soft dinosaurid wildlife of the plains, to the armored spiders and scorpions of the desert dunes.\nSmall caliber, hollow-point weapons like [b][c][dd0000]pistols[-][/c][/b] and [b][c][dd0000]submachine guns[-][/c][/b] are best suited for soft targets like wildlife and lightly armored humanoids.\nThose smaller caliber bullets will unfortunately do very little against the armor of mechanoids, androids and sentry robots.\n\nPacking more stopping power, the [b][c][0088ff]Assault[-][/c][/b] and [b][c][0088ff]Pulse Rifle[-][/c][/b] class of weapons favored by the UCH are predominantly used to put down lightly armored humanoids and have proven effective against the armored carapace of scorpions and overseers; though the ammunition of choice lacks stopping power against mechanical enemies, they're still very effective.\n\n[b][c][00ffff]Sniper Rifles[-][/c][/b] and other [b][c][00ffff]Anti-Material Rifles[-][/c][/b] used by the UCH prove effective where the Pistols and Rifles fall short, penetrating Mechanoid armor and even putting a serious dent in a Heavy Mechanoid's armor plating.\nBut that same penetration works against it against the larger, softer wildlife. Penetrating through-and-through, with less internal damage.\n\n[b][c][ffff00]Laser Weapons[-][/c][/b] are a recent addition to the UCH's line-up of weapons, with their effectiveness shared by [b][c][ffff00]Plasma weaponry[-][/c][/b].\nLaser weapons superheat their target, dealing massive thermal damage in an instant. Painful and damaging to a humanoid target, this has proven more effective and portable in dealing with mechanical enemies and light drones, melting their armor and components with a higher efficiency than expected.\nUnfortunately, the recent addition of a reflective coating on heavier drones and interceptors has reduced that effectiveness against those targets.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Shotguns[-][/c][/b] lack range and accuracy, but in the close confines of corridors and rooms these weapons make a serious mess of the lightly armored and soft targets that don't have much or any protection against a face full of buckshot.\nHowever, for those such as Heavy Mechanoids that [i]do[/i] have protection against buckshot, the shotgun barely makes a dent.\n\nAlthough not common on your average battlefield, [b][c][ffbb00]Miniguns[-][/c][/b] have proven to be more effective than previously thought once they were made small and light enough to be wielded by a soldier. Possessing an all-round effectiveness against armored targets, the Minigun is a sight to behold.\nUnfortunately, it's still heavy and possesses immense recoil, steadily draining the stamina of its wielder until it's too heavy to be fired.\n\n[b][c][ffff00]Flamethrowers[-][/c][/b], like miniguns are heavy weapons not suited for sustained firing. They do make up for it with a spectacular jet of burning fuel that will cook any form of wildlife, especially those nasty overseers and big bugs.\nUnfortunately, it's less effective against an armored humanoid and ineffective against any sort of mechanoid.\n\nFinally, we have rockets and missiles. Fast, destructive projectile weapons that will devastate whatever they hit. Most effective against drones, mechanoids and other heavily armored targets. They punch a hole inside and then detonate, leaving a smoking, burned-out husk to fall to the ground harmlessly.\n\n[c][00ff00][u][b]Outlying Weapons:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nAlthough the majority of weapons fit into the above classifications, there are some that prove to be more effective than their peers.

pda_4OKquGe,"[c][00ffee][u][b]Trading Basics:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nIf you're out and about in the galaxy, you may encounter a factory, mining site or trader in need or offering paid work. In most cases, they'll want you to find them a specific item(s) that they will pay a minimum of double the item's original market price.\nSome high-value items include industrial, commercial or medical commodities that aren't able to be crafted in a Constructor. Items such as Superconductors, Heat Exchangers, Narcotics, Scientific Equipment, Filters, Mining Equipment and any number of odd minerals and plants.\n\n[c][ffbb00][u][b]Industrial Factories:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nIndustrial commodities are typically requested by factories and a few mining operations working on deep-earth deposits. These can be obtained in small amounts from some traders on Trade Stations at exorbitant prices. For a much better deal and in larger quantities, you'll need to find and check into a factory of the right type.\nFactories don't typically deal with end consumers, so you'll probably need to prove your value by doing a job for them; Though in many cases, these factories break down or run out of materials and may just want supplies. At the very least, even after providing assistance, they'll have a ready supply of jobs for you to undertake for a good pay-out.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Arriake Technology[-][/c][/b] is an [b][c][ff5c5c]Electronics Factory[-][/c][/b] that deals in Superconductors, Communication Equipment and Optronics. They are a main supplier of QuantumStar.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Solaris-AMP[-][/c][/b] is an [b][c][ff5c5c]Electronics Factory[-][/c][/b] that deals in energy generation, and so produce Superconductors, Reactor Cores and Solar Cells.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]P3[-][/c][/b] is an Industrial Factory that produces low-cost industrial equipment such as Mining Equipment, Spare Parts and Prefab Housing.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Zero Horizons Manufacturing[-][/c][/b] is an Industrial Factory that operates in space, using Zero-G manufacturing to produce high quality Thruster Components, Heat Exchangers and Optronics.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Non-Linear Productions[-][/c][/b] is an Industrial Factory that specializes in Radioactive protection; producing Reactor Cores, Radiation Shielding, Mining Equipment and even Advanced Warp Drives.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Chromium-Sierra Sciences[-][/c][/b] is a Scientific Producer of medical equipment such as Air Filters, Scientific Equipment, Tablets and Chemicals.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Thermal Interactions Ltd[-][/c][/b] is another Industrial Factory that deals primarily in heat distribution and radiation equipment. As such their main products consist of Heat Exchangers, Coolant and Radiation Shielding.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Hostile Apparatus[-][/c][/b] is a Robotics Factory. Their main products include portable security mechanoids and androids, but also extend to Spare Parts, Robotics and Data Tablets.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Vitalife Pharmaceuticals[-][/c][/b] is a Medical Producer that supplies both medical components, Filters and restricted narcotics to a variety of stores across the galaxy from Andromedical to Ok'y Medical.\n\nAlthough not technically a factory, there are a number of [c][66ccff][b]Gas Harvesters[/b][-][/c] in space that trawl the upper atmosphere of gas giants for rare gases, and serve as an ideal source of Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen and Xenon.\n\n[b][c][66ccff]Chemical Refineries[-][/c][/b] also serve as a source of Chemicals, Helium and Filters.\n\n[c][ff00ff][u][b]Other Industrial Locations:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nOutside of the normal commodity-based factories are [b][c][ffbb00]Waste Treatment Plants[-][/c][/b] that will buy your Toxic Waste and other waste products and break them down into Fertilizer, Nitrogen and any number of useful inert products.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]InterWeapon[-][/c][/b] have any number of munitions factories that produce high-end ammunition at low cost and will even exchange Sulfur for Nitrocellulose at a 1:20 rate.\nSulfur can be mined from magmatic rock on any volcanic (lava) planet.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Totally Overpowered Brewery[-][/c][/b] supplies high-quality liquors and beer at low prices. [b][c][00bb00]Tal'on[-][/c][/b] also operate [b][c][00bb00]breweries[-][/c][/b] with superior prices and quality, but their production amounts are quite low.\n\n[b][c][00bb00]Tal'on[-][/c][/b] also operate [b][c][00bb00]Tanneries[-][/c][/b] and [b][c][00bb00]Quarries[-][/c][/b] that are a good source of Leather and Diamonds respectively, among a number of other products.\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nThere are yet even more factories and facilities out there that deal with even more exotic and strange items and commodities. Just as there are equally strange requests from [c][00ffff][b]Traders [/b][-][/c]on trade stations and [b][c][00ffff]Mining Operations[-][/c][/b] where a steady supply of resources brings in the big credits.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Hacked Data[-][/c][/b] is a commonly requested item among station traders. Whether that be information on a rival or a leg-up on the galactic market there is always money to be made from information somewhere.\nThis information can be hacked out of the [b][c][ff0000]Communication Satellites[-][/c][/b] located in the empty space around Stars when warping into a system. You can also find similar terminals in any number of Communication Stations operated by the Zirax, so you'll inevitably encounter a hackable terminal sooner or later.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Hacking Software[-][/c][/b] will make it much easier, though try to avoid being caught by the authorities while carrying it.\nHacking a friendly satellite does not incur a reputation penalty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is just general guidance.\n\nFirst, make sure your immediate surroundings are safe then read over any starting mission text (if there is any) and the information in the planet description. You can usually get a good idea of what you need to do based on those two things.\n\nNext you will need to find some [-][/c][c][00ff00]Iron Ore[-][/c][c][abd1ff] and gain some xp to level up to unlock the [-][/c][c][00ff00]Portable Constructor[-][/c][c][abd1ff] in the tech tree [-][/c][c][ffff00]({keybind(TechTree)})[-][/c][c][abd1ff].

Once you've built a Portable Constructor you can use it to refine raw ore into ingots or extract raw ore from crushed stone.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Also be on the lookout for Carbon Rich surface rocks or Graphite deposits, as you may need them.\nFood can be obtained from wild plants and animals, or from your starting missions.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]If you are on a planet without oxygen, you will also need to set up a [-][/c][c][00ff00]O2 Condenser[-][/c][c][abd1ff] to obtain oxygen.[-][/c]\n\n[c][abd1ff]Some planets can have dangerous wildlife, soldiers, or drones hunting you, or extreme environments with radiation, temperature, or weather hazards.

Use this to keep them away from you.[-][/c]\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c][c][abd1ff]Pay attention to tooltips on wild plants.

eden_pda_4WFCWGm,"{LogoRE2.png}[c][abd1ff]Reforged Eden 2 is a complete game overhaul that combines Vermillion's Reforged Galaxy 2 and ravien_ff's Project Eden 2 content into a single scenario.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Nearly every block, weapon, POI, planet, trader, and mission has been updated or replaced and a large amount of new content added. This greatly changes the game experience.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Reforged Eden 2 is very different in many ways from Reforged Eden 1 with different block limits, CPU allocation, power usage, etc. Some of the values may seem shocking at first if you are coming from Reforged Eden 1 but this is why it's important to look at Reforged Eden 2 as its own scenario.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Reforged Eden 2 increases the overall difficulty and slows down progression. It is intended for experienced players looking for a more difficult, long term PvE experience with a variety of ways to progress and new things to explore.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Blueprints created for Reforged Eden 2 may not be compatible with the base game or Reforged Eden 1 and blueprints for the base game or Reforged Eden 1 may require extensive refit to work properly in Reforged Eden 2.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]The scenario is still under active development so this information is subject to change.

[-][/c][c][ffff00][u]You must follow the directions in the guide for your server to function correctly.[/u][-][/c]\n\n[c][00ffff]Does Reforged Eden 2 work in COOP?[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Yes it does work, however COOP has several bugs.\n16gb of computer memory is strongly recommended for COOP, but it is generally best to run a true dedicated server instead.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]We do not support COOP in the scenario.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c][c][00ffff][-][/c]\n[c][00ffff]Does Reforged Eden 2 work on a dedicated server?[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Yes Reforged Eden 2 works with dedicated servers.\nReforged Eden 2 uses the full galaxy generation so keep in mind the size of the game world will be immense as it's meant to be played solo, COOP, or on dedicated servers for small groups.[-][/c]\n\n[c][00ffff]Why is the loading time longer?[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]When initially loading the scenario, the game has to generate the fixed sectors and this can cause loading to take longer than normal.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]There is also more content and custom asset bundles to load.[-][/c]\n[c][00ffff][-][/c]\n[c][00ffff]Is there any customization I can make to the scenario for my server?[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Yes. You can feel free to edit any of the scenario's configuration or playfield files as you see fit, but [-][/c][u][c][ff0000]doing this is at your own risk[-][/c][/u][c][abd1ff]. I cannot offer support for using customized configurations with the scenario and some things can break your save game.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]There is also a Project Eden Admin Control you can access from within the game under the Tutorial tab of the PDA to change certain global scenario settings.[-][/c]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eden_pda_SAaqaJG,"\n[c][00afff]Be Prepared:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]If you think you are prepared, you are not prepared.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Fighting in a ship is no joke and if you're using a poorly armed or armored ship you are unlikely to succeed.[-][/c]\n[c][00ff00]Patrol vessels[-][/c][c][abd1ff] and [-][/c][c][00ff00]military bases[-][/c][c][abd1ff] can have powerful [-][/c][c][00ff00]shields[-][/c][c][abd1ff] and devastating weapons.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Some of these weapons will have a small amount of [-][/c][c][00ff00]shield penetration[-][/c][c][abd1ff].[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]You should make sure your ship is up to the task at hand before engaging an enemy.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Install Alarm Sentries:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Alarm sentries are specialized turrets that instead of dealing damage to enemies, will play an audio alert if they see an enemy.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]They can be a useful tool for alerting you to danger if you are outside of your ship or focused on mining or salvaging.[-][/c]\n\n[c][00afff]Use armor:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]A ship protected by hardened or combat steel will prove much more durable than one protected only by carbon fiber or regular steel.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Taking a ship built mainly out of carbon fiber or steel into combat is recommended only if you enjoy the inevitable fireworks show as your warp core explodes in a brilliant flash of light moments before waking up in a clone chamber back at your home base.[-][/c]\n\n[c][00afff]Use the right weapons for the job:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Choosing your weapon loadout for your ship is one of the most important design decisions.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]It's important to balance your loadout so you can do the most damage possible versus the target you are fighting.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Each weapon has damage bonuses versus certain types of targets, clip sizes, and fire rates. It is up to you to use the right weapons for your ship design, play style, and target.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Remember that you can only fire one type of manual weapon at a time whereas turrets can always fire. Adjust your weapon loadout accordingly.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Higher tier weapons are more CPU efficient but are not always the best option.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Setup your turret targeting so you don't have artillery turrets trying to shoot drones for example.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Don't be afraid to fall back:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Bases can't move and patrol vessels don't move as fast as you. If you start taking too much damage, fall back to a safe distance and re-assess the situation.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Remember that [-][/c][c][00ff00]space drones[-][/c][c][abd1ff] can keep up with you, so you should make sure to destroy them as quickly as possible if you do need to retreat.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]The shield remaining display on your HUD can be delayed especially on multiplayer servers. Your actual shield amount remaining is always less than what is showing on the display.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Objects in HUD are closer than they appear:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]The range to a target shown on your HUD is measured from your camera position to the center of the target. The actual range of your ship's closest targetable devices versus the enemy turrets can be hundreds of meters less than that. Don't be lulled into a mistaken sense of security thinking you're out of range of the enemy.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Most enemy turrets also have a longer range than your own turrets to prevent you from being able to easily dip in and out of range without risk.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Targeting settings:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]You can change the settings on your turret's to choose what targets they will fire at.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]if you want to change the entire device group, simply select the group and set your options there, then hit the apply to group button.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]It is recommended to generally leave Warp Drive off of your targeting options, as that is used to target Rich Asteroids.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]It is also recommended to setup device groups or signals on your control panel to easily turn on or off different types of turrets.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Don't turn your ship into a flying bomb:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Some devices will explode and damage nearby blocks when they are destroyed.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Separating those devices with layers of hardened or combat steel can prevent chain explosions.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Old tricks won't work:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Your old tricks such as burrowing under a base or pinning a patrol vessel in place may not be as effective as they once were, and sometimes may end up backfiring. The enemy has evolved.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Find what works for you:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]There are many tactics for defeating enemy patrol vessels and bases. Some prefer to destroy the generators or cores, while others will destroy the turrets then go in on foot. Some will sit still and tank the damage while others prefer to dodge as much incoming fire as possible.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Your personal play style, the type of ship you are flying, the weapons you're using, and the enemy you are fighting will all determine which tactics will be successful for you.[-][/c]\n[c][00afff][-][/c]\n[c][00afff]Avoid combat:[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]And if you find yourself exploring in a ship not up to the task of combat, consider avoiding combat until you are better prepared.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Use your detector and alarm sentries to avoid enemy patrol vessels and bases and equip your ship with weapons good at destroying enemy drones such as gatling turrets.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Different planets, moons, and space sectors will have different quantities and tiers of enemies. There are many which are safe or have few enemies.[-][/c]\n[c][abd1ff]Travel to the territory of a friendly faction.[-][/c]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A planet is its own playfield, as is a moon and a space orbit. Going from planet to orbit means you enter a new playfield.\n[c][00afff]Sector:[-][/c] Any location on the solar system map that you can warp to. A sector encompasses a planet, its orbit, and any of its moons. A standalone asteroid field can also be a sector.\n\n[c][00afff]Star System:[-][/c] An object on the galaxy map containing a star with various planets and sector POIs. Can also be referred to as a Solar System, System, or Star. The star type influences what you will find there.\n[c][00afff]Nebula:[-][/c] A gaseous cloud located within the galaxy.\n[c][00afff]Galaxy:[-][/c] The entire game world seen in the galaxy map containing thousands of stars.\n[c][00afff]Faction Territory:[-][/c] This can refer to the faction territory displayed on a planet's surface, or on the faction territory on the galactic map.
